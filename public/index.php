      <h1>Who I am</h1>
      <p>
        I am a geek from Bradford, UK. I currently work for Sky Bet in Leeds as a Principal Engineer.
        I like to learn things and <a href="https://github.com/TomNomNom">write code</a>.
      </p>

    <section class="info">
      <h1>Things I like</h1>
      <p>
        I like computers; especially solving problems with computers. I write
        quite a bit of PHP, and a bit of <a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I&rsquo;m at work I help build, fix and improve large-scale, highly-available and real-time systems with
        technologies like PHP, Node.js, Redis, MySQL, Memcached, RabbitMQ and MongoDB.

      <h1>Open Source</h1>
      <p>
        I&rsquo;ve not worked on as much Open Source stuff as I would like. Although I do release a lot
        of the code I write outside of work, it&rsquo;s not always that useful.
      </p>

      <h2>Etherpad Lite</h2>
      <p>
        I have helped to maintain the <a href="http://etherpad.org/">Etherpad Lite</a> 
        <a href="https://github.com/TomNomNom/etherpad-lite-client">PHP client</a>. It&rsquo;s by 
        no means a complex client, but I&rsquo;m proud to be a part of the project. 
      </p>

      <h2>Raspberry Pi User Guide</h2>
      <p>
        Whilst not strictly open source, I contributed a <a href="http://media.wiley.com/product_ancillary/6X/11184644/DOWNLOAD/ircuserlist.py">Python program</a>
        to the <a href="http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-111846446X.html">Official Raspberry Pi User Guide</a>. 
        It&rsquo;s a simple program designed to demonstrate basic network programming by connecting
        to an <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr> server and listing the connected users.

      <h1>Places I have worked</h1>
      <p>
        I have decided to miss out the time that I worked for a paintball centre.
        It was fun, but it taught me very little about computers.
      </p>

      <h2>Sky Bet</h2>
      <p>
        I started at Sky Bet in February 2011 as a software engineer. I worked in an Agile team on Sky Bet&rsquo;s 
        <abbr title="Linux Apache MySQL PHP">LAMP</abbr>-based <abbr title="Single Sign On">SSO</abbr>
        system that now powers <a href="http://www.skybet.com/betting">Sky Bet</a>,
        <a href="http://www.skyvegas.com/vegas">Sky Vegas</a>, 
        <a href="http://fantasyfootball.skysports.com/">Sky Sports&rsquo; Fantasy Football</a> and
        <a href="http://www.challenge.co.uk/">Challenge.co.uk</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In August 2011 I became Sky Bet&rsquo;s first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps">DevOps</a> 
        engineer. I worked on trend monitoring with <a href="http://graphite.wikidot.com/">Graphite</a>, 
        automation with <a href="http://www.opscode.com/chef/">Chef</a> and helped our developers to improve
        <a href="http://www.skyvegas.com/vegas">Sky Vegas</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In October 2012 I was promoted to Senior DevOps Engineer. While 
        much of my day to day life remained the same I made more 
        decisions and helped our newer DevOps Engineers get up to speed.
      </p>
      <p>
        From October 2013 to January 2015 I was a Solutions Architect
        working on new products, features and real-time trading systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        In January 2015 it was suggested that my talents would be better
        used as a Principal Engineer, working on whatever problems are
        the most pressing at the time - and mentoring other engineers 
        on the best practices for development, testing and operations.
      </p>

      <h2>FrogTrade</h2>
      <p>
        From 2008 until 2010 I worked at Halifax-based <abbr title="Virtual Learning Environment">VLE</abbr>
        provider <a href="http://frogtrade.com/">FrogTrade</a> as a Web Applications Developer,
        and later as Software Architect. Much of my time as a developer was spent helping to iron 
        the bugs out of FrogTrade&rsquo;s half-million line codebase, and adding much requested new features.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Software Architect I designed a controller and view system for a new product and 
        back-ported it to the existing software. I also laid the foundations for a flexible, XML-based
        reporting system.
      </p>

      <h2>Primary Technology</h2>
      <p>
        I originally started at <a href="http://www.primaryt.co.uk/">Primary Technology</a> as a network
        engineer in 2005; maintaining Windows-based networks in Bradford primary schools. I later became
        the Hosted Services Director where I managed an Exchange-based hosted email system, remote access
        system and wrote a web-based ticket management system.
