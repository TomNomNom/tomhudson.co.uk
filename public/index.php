      <p>
        I am a geek from Bradford, UK. I currently work for Sky Bet in Leeds as a Principal Engineer.
        I like to learn things and <a href="https://github.com/TomNomNom">write code</a>.

      <h1><a href="#likes">Things I like</a></h1>
      <p>
        I like computers; especially solving problems with computers. I write
        quite a bit of PHP, and a bit of <a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I&rsquo;m at work I help build, fix and improve large-scale, highly-available and real-time systems with
        technologies like PHP, Node.js, Redis, MySQL, Memcached, RabbitMQ and MongoDB.

    <section class="info" id="work">
      <h1><a href="#work">Places I have worked</a></h1>
      <p>
        I&rsquo;ve decided to miss out the time that I worked for a paintball centre.
        It was fun, but it taught me very little about computers.
      </p>

      <h2>Sky Bet</h2>
      <p>
        I've worked at Sky Bet since 2011 when I joined as a software engineer. I&rsquo;ve held 4 more
        job titles since then: DevOps Engineer, Senior DevOps Engineer, Solutions Architect and now: Principal Engineer.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result of my many job titles, I've been involved in a pretty broad range of things; like building an
        <abbr title="Single Sign On">SSO</abbr> system, building real-time monitoring with <a href="http://graphite.wikidot.com/">Graphite</a>,
        replacing an antiquated configuration management system with <a href="http://www.opscode.com/chef/">Chef</a>,
        and even building a monitoring system that does <abbr title="Optical Character Recognition">OCR</abbr>
        on a live video stream to make sure it&rsquo;s in sync.
      </p>
      <p>
        My day-to-day mostly revolves around mentoring other engineers, writing <abbr title="Proof Of Concept">POC</abbr>
        code, researching and assessing new technologies and techniques, and just plain old fixing things when they break.
      </p>

      <h2>FrogTrade</h2>
      <p>
        From 2008 until 2010 I worked at Halifax-based <abbr title="Virtual Learning Environment">VLE</abbr>
        provider <a href="http://frogtrade.com/">FrogTrade</a> as a Web Applications Developer,
        and later as Software Architect. Much of my time as a developer was spent helping to iron
        the bugs out of FrogTrade&rsquo;s half-million line codebase, and adding much requested new features.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Software Architect I designed a controller and view system for a new product and
        back-ported it to the existing software. I also laid the foundations for a flexible, XML-based
        reporting system.
      </p>

      <h2>Primary Technology</h2>
      <p>
        I originally started at <a href="http://www.primaryt.co.uk/">Primary Technology</a> as a network
        engineer in 2005; maintaining Windows-based networks in Bradford primary schools. I later became
        the Hosted Services Director where I managed an Exchange-based hosted email system, remote access
        system and wrote a web-based ticket management system.

    <section class="info" id="opensource">
      <h1><a href="#opensource">Open Source</a></h1>
      <p>
        I&rsquo;ve not worked on as much Open Source stuff as I would like, but here are a few things
        that I have worked on.
      </p>

      <h2>Phargs</h2>
      <p>
        I wrote <a href="https://github.com/TomNomNom/phargs">Phargs</a> to take the pain out of writing <abbr title="Command Line Interface">CLI</abbr>
        tools in PHP, particularly argument processing. It&rsquo;s very much a toolkit rather than a framework, so you can easily pick and choose
        the bits you need and ignore the rest.
      </p>

      <h2>Etherpad Lite</h2>
      <p>
        I have helped to maintain the <a href="http://etherpad.org/">Etherpad Lite</a>
        <a href="https://github.com/TomNomNom/etherpad-lite-client">PHP client</a>. It&rsquo;s by
        no means a complex client, but I&rsquo;m proud to be a part of the project.
      </p>

      <h2>Goomwwm</h2>
      <p>
        A minor contribution, but I <a href="http://tomnomnom.com/posts/debugging-a-segfault-in-goomwwm">fixed a segfault in Goomwwm</a>.
        The fix was simple, but the debugging less so.
      </p>

      <h2>Pwas</h2>
      <p>
        I&rsquo;d never suggest anyone ran it in production, but I wrote <a href="https://github.com/TomNomNom/Pwas">a forking webserver in PHP</a>
        to improve my understanding of HTTP.
      </p>

      <h2>Gosseract</h2>
      <p>
        I added Tesseract 3.03 support to <a href="https://github.com/otiai10/gosseract">gosseract</a>
        (a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract_(software)">Tesseract</a> wrapper for Go), and improved the test suite.
      </p>

      <h2>Raspberry Pi User Guide</h2>
      <p>
        I contributed a <a href="http://media.wiley.com/product_ancillary/6X/11184644/DOWNLOAD/ircuserlist.py">Python program</a>
        to the <a href="http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-111846446X.html">Official Raspberry Pi User Guide</a>.
        It&rsquo;s a simple program designed to demonstrate basic network programming by connecting
        to an <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr> server and listing the connected users.
